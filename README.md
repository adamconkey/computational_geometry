üößüë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Work In Progress:** This repos is under heavy development right now and just in its nascent stages.

---

Currently the algorithms are implemented following Joseph O'Rourke's [Computational Geometry in C](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/computational-geometry-in-c/22A04E03A4BB10C382A1257F64477E1B).

This is very much a work in progress, I'm just stepping through the text and implementing things as I go. I'm also a Rust newb so I'm frequently stumbling through the implementations, finding I made a terrible design decision, and going back to reimplement things. As such the API is in constant flux.

My goal for this repo is to eventually have a complete implementation of the algorithms described in the text, which will serve as the basis of a computational geometry library in Rust. I will then build from there, exploring more modern concepts and algorithms. My priorities are to have relatively easy-to-read code, a great test suite, and nice visualizations. I will have these three objectives in mind as I build out this repo.

- Area
- Triangulation - $O(n^2)$
- Rotation and translation
- Bounding box
- Convex hull (various implementations for benchmarking)

    - From extreme edges $O(n^3)$
    - GiftWrapping $O(nh)$ for $h$ hull edges
    - QuickHull $O(n^2)$

### On the Roadmap
- Graham scan for 2D convex hull

## Visualizer

A visualizer is provided using [rerun.io](https://rerun.io). You must have the `rerun` viewer installed for this to work, you can follow their instructions [here](https://rerun.io/docs/getting-started/installing-viewer#installing-the-viewer). This method worked well for me:
```shell
cargo install rerun-cli --locked
```

Here are some example visualizations (add the `-h` option for further CLI documentation):

```shell
cargo run --features visualizer -- -v triangulation -f interesting_polygon_archive -p skimage_horse
```

```shell
cargo run --features visualizer -- -v extreme-points -f interesting_polygon_archive -p skimage_horse
```

## Benchmarks

Some simple benchmarking capabilities are provided using [Criterion.rs](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/). These are mostly to provide empirical intuition on the runtime of algorithms. Currently only a benchmark for 2D convex hull algorithms is setup, more will be added as more algorithms are implemented.

You can run the benchmarks yourself with
```shell
cargo bench --bench convex_hull
```

Here is a visualization comparing the various implementations:

This is obviously not super informative, but exists more as a starting infrastructure for benchmarking than a meaningful comparison at this stage.
