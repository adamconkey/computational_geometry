# Computational Geometry in Rust

![TEST](https://github.com/adamconkey/computational_geometry/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml/badge.svg)

Repo for playing around with implementing computational geometry algorithms from scratch in Rust.

Currently the algorithms are implemented following Joseph O'Rourke's [Computational Geometry in C](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/computational-geometry-in-c/22A04E03A4BB10C382A1257F64477E1B).
